### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught developer with over three years of hands-on experience,
actively contributing to open-source projects.

I enjoy learning on my own and collaborating with teams. Whether it's frontend,
backend, testing, or automating tasks, I like being versatile.

I love trying out new technologies in my pet projects. I also contribute to
open source and tweak my dotfiles and Neovim setup for a better coding
experience.

Most importantly, I believe in keeping things fun, collaborating well,
including everyone, and being true to myself on this journey!
