# Binh Tran

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent graduate and a self-taught developer passionate about both
frontend and backend development, with a dream to create innovative and
intelligent open-source tools.

I enjoy collaborating with teams and experimenting with new technologies in my
personal projects. I also contribute to the open-source community while
continuously improving my coding environment through dotfiles and Neovim
configurations. For me, itâ€™s all about having fun, fostering collaboration, and
staying true to my values on this exciting journey.
