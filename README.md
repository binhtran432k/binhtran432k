### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught developer with over three years of hands-on experience, actively contributing to open-source projects.
I enjoy learning on my own and collaborating with teams, being versatile across frontend, backend, testing, and automation.

I love experimenting with new technologies in my pet projects and contribute to open source while refining my coding
environment through dotfiles and Neovim setup.
Most importantly, my journey is about keeping things fun, fostering collaboration, inclusivity, and staying true to myself.
